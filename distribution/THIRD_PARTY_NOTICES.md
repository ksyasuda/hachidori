The Emscripten and runtime notices are copied from Emscripten
[4.0.15, commit 09f52557f0d48b65b8c724853ed8f4e8bf80e669](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/tree/09f52557f0d48b65b8c724853ed8f4e8bf80e669):
`LICENSE`, `system/lib/libc/musl/COPYRIGHT`, and
`system/lib/{libcxx,libcxxabi,compiler-rt,libunwind}/LICENSE.TXT` respectively.
Trailing whitespace is normalized. This identifies the notice sources; the historical committed Wasm binaries
did not record an exact Emscripten compiler version.

The zip.js source archive URL and checksum are recorded in
`scripts/store-sources.json` in the matching source archive. The zip.js
`dist/zip-core-external.min.js` file is byte-checked against the shipped
`vendor/zip.js` when packaging.

User-selected dictionaries, media, and external audio services are separate
from this distribution. Their licenses and terms are supplied by their owners.
