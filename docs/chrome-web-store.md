# Chrome Web Store assessment and publishing guide

Initial audit: **8 September 2026**, against
[`5101f38460004544b60d49ec14a8bd334841e429`](https://github.com/bee-san/hachidori/tree/5101f38460004544b60d49ec14a8bd334841e429).
This guide now describes the store preparation implemented after that audit.
Recheck the actual release candidate and Google's linked policies before
submitting it; Google makes the final acceptance decision.

## Readiness

Hachidori uses Manifest V3 with bundled JavaScript and WebAssembly. Its local
Japanese dictionary, pronunciation and Anki study features fit one understandable
purpose. The repository now includes the disclosures, store artwork and release
packaging needed to prepare a submission.

| Area | Preparation included | At publication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Privacy | [The privacy policy](privacy.md) describes local data, providers, screenshots, backups, retention and contact. Settings and setup link to it. | The GitHub policy URL must be readable without signing in. The repository was private at audit time. |
| First run | One short welcome and **Start setup** precede automatic dictionary downloads and local Anki discovery. Accepted runs resume automatically; **Set up manually** skips both. | Describe this behavior in the listing and verify it in the uploaded build. |
| Audio | HTTP localhost audio and custom-provider redirects remain supported. Audio Settings explains word/reading sharing and recommends HTTPS for remote sources. Linked mining fetches URL providers on the host while browser speech is playback-only. | Disclose configured provider/voice behavior; do not claim every audio source is offline or encrypted. |
| Permissions | The redundant `tabs` permission is removed. Host access supplies reading-page access. | Use the justifications below for the submitted manifest. |
| Assets | [Store assets](store/README.md) include a 440 × 280 promotional tile and genuine 1280 × 800 extension screenshots using original sample material. | Upload the supplied icon/tile/screenshots and check they match the release UI. |
| Licensing/source | [The packaging command](../scripts/package-store.py) includes the GPL license, dependency notices, policy and a checksummed source reference. It produces a matching source archive with recursive submodules and pinned dependency sources. | Make that source archive accessible to recipients and give its location in the listing. |

**Localhost audio is not a rejection issue by itself.** Google's
[user-data FAQ](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/user-data-faq)
exempts same-computer native communication from transmission encryption and
separately discusses clients using user-specified servers. Yomitan's official
[custom-audio examples](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan/blob/master/ext/templates-modals.html)
use HTTP localhost. Hachidori preserves compatible user-selected HTTP(S) sources and
redirects, with explicit disclosure and an HTTPS recommendation for remote
services. That is not a promise about how a third-party provider handles data.

Broad page access still needs justification under Google's
[minimum-permissions policy](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/permissions).
The welcome and settings copy provide the relevant
[in-product disclosures](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/disclosure-requirements).

### What already fits, and what needs an honest explanation

- **Bundled code:** the dictionary engine, workers and ZIP library
  live under `extension/`. The audited loading paths do not fetch remote JS or
  WASM. Dictionary ZIPs, update indexes, audio lists and media are data, not
  downloaded extension logic. The manifest's `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` is Chrome's
  supported mechanism for bundled Wasm, not permission to execute remote scripts.
  See [remote hosted code](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/remote-hosted-code)
  and [extension CSP](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/content-security-policy).
- **Page screenshots:** the enabled-by-default **Screenshot the page when mining** switch
  takes one picture when a field maps `{screenshot}` and the user chooses Add or
  Overwrite. In a linked browser the final JPEG goes through the sharing host.
- **Content and claims:** use material you have permission to show in store
  screenshots and verify rights for recommended dictionary distribution and
  audio sources. Avoid copying the README's unqualified “fastest”
  claim into the listing. Google's [program policies](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/policies)
  cover misleading claims, intellectual property and unauthorized media access.

## Permissions to explain in the dashboard

Use this as a source-based draft, then update it to match the submitted manifest.
Google requires [a justification for each permission](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/cws-dashboard-privacy).

| Permission | Hachidori use and proposed explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `storage` | Save dictionary configuration, reader preferences, custom entries, lookup counts, Anki settings and the newest automatic backup records (two days by default, configurable) locally. The engine stores dictionary indexes separately in OPFS or IndexedDB. |
| `unlimitedStorage` | Keep user-imported dictionaries and their generated indexes in OPFS or IndexedDB exempt from ordinary extension storage quotas and storage-pressure eviction. |
| `offscreen` | Run the local dictionary engine and pronunciation playback,  [The worker](../extension/background.js) requests `DOM_SCRAPING` and `AUDIO_PLAYBACK`. |
| `alarms` | Run the user's configured dictionary update schedules, refresh the local Anki duplicate index every 30 minutes when Anki mining is configured, and schedule at most one local automatic backup per 24 hours. Scheduled runs can install dictionary data updates; they do not replace extension code. |
| `downloads` | Save an explicitly requested local backup ZIP and monitor that export's completion. [The implementation](../extension/backup-downloads.js) tracks its own export IDs. |
| `<all_urls>` host access | Fetch dictionaries and updates from configured HTTPS sources, pronunciation from configured sources, communicate with local Anki, and capture the visible reading page for mapped mining screenshots. Explain arbitrary source support and why a fixed allowlist does not cover the shipped feature. |
| `<all_urls>` content-script matching | Read Japanese text near the pointer/selection and display dictionary results on the user's reading pages. A fixed website list cannot cover where users read. User-enabled local-file access can support local reading pages. |
| `tabs` | Removed. Host permissions support the reading pages. |

The permission reduction follows Google's [Tabs API permission explanation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs#permissions).
Changing to `activeTab` would require a user invocation before access and would
change the current hover-everywhere interaction. Optional host grants are a
possible product change, not something this documentation silently assumes.

## Privacy policy and data-use answers

The canonical policy is a plain Markdown file at [docs/privacy.md](privacy.md).
Its intended store URL is
`https://github.com/bee-san/hachidori/blob/main/docs/privacy.md`.
The upload ZIP also includes a copy. No separate website is required.

**Check the GitHub URL signed out before submitting.** Creating the file in a
private repository does not make it public. After merging, make the policy
readable publicly through the chosen GitHub publication arrangement. This PR
does not change repository visibility. Use the public contact email in the
policy for support while the issue tracker is private.

The policy contains the required affirmative
[Limited Use statement](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/limited-use).
Keep it, the store listing, data-use checkboxes and UI consistent.

The policy covers the paths below; use this mapping when completing the dashboard:

| Data or operation | Current handling to disclose | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page text and lookup activity | Pointer/selection text and surrounding context support lookup and mining. Local statistics retain term, reading, count and first/last lookup timestamps. Turning off lookup counts pauses recording and preserves past rows, which do not store page URLs. | [Reader](../extension/content.js), [statistics](../extension/lookup-stats.js) |
| Dictionaries and personal settings | Imported/generated dictionaries and custom entries remain in extension storage. Preferences include Custom buttons, custom URLs, CSS, Anki Templates and an optional AnkiConnect API key. | [Storage ownership](architecture.md#storage-ownership) |
| Dictionary downloads | After Start setup, the installer downloads Jitendex, JMnedict, Bee's Ultimate Kanji Dictionary, Jiten Frequency Dictionary and Bee's Ultimate Grammar Dictionary. Their GitHub/GitHub asset hosts, jitendex.org and api.jiten.moe receive ordinary requests/IP metadata. Managed updates contact installed source URLs when checked or scheduled. These requests are not a remote term-lookup service. | [Catalogue](../extension/recommended-dictionaries.js), [updates](update-schedules.md) |
| Pronunciation | Configured custom audio providers receive the expression/reading substituted into their URLs. Built-in speech uses the browser/OS voice; the code does not require a `localService` voice, so do not promise every voice works offline. During linked mining, URL providers run on the host and browser speech is used for playback only. | [Sources](../extension/audio-sources.js), [player](../extension/audio-player.js) |
| Anki | Requests go to `http://127.0.0.1:8765` by default. After Start setup, Anki discovery reads deck/model/card/note metadata. The first Anki Template powers the built-in action and the scoped duplicate index, which refreshes every 30 minutes and stores only each word, its aggregate maturity flag and matching note IDs; warm Prevent-mode View readiness reads it without Anki, mining misses can perform a scoped repair lookup, and clicking View validates and repairs those IDs live. Mature-word blur reads that local index. Custom Anki buttons can choose other Templates. Explicit mining can send selected text, definitions, page title, page address, downloadable audio and dictionary images according to the selected Template's field mappings. A linked browser transfers the selected Template ID, note data and final screenshot and dictionary media to its sharing host, which uses only the host's saved AnkiConnect URL/API key and Templates for Settings discovery/setup checks, mining checks and writes; the linked browser's duplicate-index alarm is suspended. Anki controls any subsequent sync. | [Gateway](../extension/anki.js), [setup](../extension/anki-setup.js), [index](../extension/anki-index.js), [mining](../extension/anki-mining.js) |
| Page screenshots | With Screenshot the page when mining enabled and a field mapping `{screenshot}`, Add or Overwrite takes one picture of the whole visible reading page directly from the active tab. The switch is on by default. The picture stays in temporary memory and is sent to the configured Anki with the note; when linked, the reading browser sends the final JPEG to the sharing host for that transaction. | [Mining](../extension/anki-content.js), [screenshot ownership](../extension/background.js) |
| Other external resources | Explicit external dictionary links open dictionary-supplied HTTP(S) URLs, which may contain terms or other parameters. User-written popup CSS may fetch URL resources. Their destination hosts may receive request metadata; dictionary CSS has separate restrictions. | [Renderer](../extension/render/glossary.js), [links](../extension/external-links.js), [custom CSS](architecture.md#custom-popup-css) |
| Backups and deletion | The newest automatic daily snapshots (two days by default; Settings chooses how many) stay in the browser profile and contain the same saved settings, custom entries and statistics as a manual backup payload, including a configured AnkiConnect API key. Clearing current settings does not remove their older retained values until later snapshots replace them or the extension is uninstalled. User-requested ZIPs additionally contain dictionary files; they are unencrypted and remain outside the profile until separately deleted. Automatic and manual backups exclude the derived Anki duplicate index. | [Backup format](backup-format.md) |

No analytics/advertising SDK or developer-operated lookup collection endpoint was
found in the audited runtime. That does **not** mean the extension handles no
user data or never contacts third parties. Ordinary Chrome storage, automatic
snapshots and backup ZIPs are not separately application-encrypted; review
API-key storage and retained/exported secrets
against Google’s [secure-handling requirements](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/data-handling)
and [user-data FAQ](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/user-data-faq) before certifying. The existing
backup export UI explicitly warns that the ZIP is unencrypted and can contain
API keys. The policy describes that behavior; this preparation does not add a
new encryption or credential-storage system.

For the dashboard's data categories, evaluate **Website content**, **User activity** (lookups),
**Web history** (the page title and address a Template can write into a mined note), and
**Authentication information** (the optional AnkiConnect key). Page screenshots can also contain sensitive information. These are starting
points for mapping the shipped behavior to the current form, not a pre-completed
certification. Do not select “no user data” simply because most work is local.

## Publish step by step

### 1. Finish the release candidate

Review the preparation changes and follow the repository's review gates before
merging the release candidate. Record the
release commit and choose a manifest version higher than any previously uploaded
version (`0.1.1` is the current manifest version, not an instruction to reuse it
after it has been uploaded).

Use the [test harness setup](../test/README.md) and run the release checks against
that candidate, recording exact outcomes:

```sh
node test/make-fixture.mjs
node test/node-smoke.mjs
node test/extension-smoke.mjs
node test/chrome-e2e.mjs
node test/chrome-fallback.mjs
```

These are release instructions. The pull request records which checks were run
for its exact changes and any test-environment limitations.

### 2. Make the upload ZIP

Google needs **`manifest.json` at the ZIP root**. The release command packages
tracked runtime files with their licenses and the privacy policy, then creates
a matching source ZIP containing recursive submodules and pinned zip.js
sources. Existing dictionary Wasm bundles are included unchanged unless
the release intentionally rebuilds them. See [source/build instructions](source-build.md)
and [Google's package preparation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/prepare).

From a clean, committed release checkout with Git and Python 3.9 or newer:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
python3 scripts/package-store.py --output-dir /tmp/hachidori-store
```

The command writes three files outside the repository:

- `hachidori-<version>-<commit>-chrome.zip`: upload this to the store.
- `hachidori-<version>-<commit>-source.zip`: distribute the matching source.
- `hachidori-<version>-<commit>-SHA256SUMS.txt`: checksums of both ZIPs.

A checksum-verified source cache avoids repeated downloads; override its
location with `--cache-dir /path/to/cache` if needed. The source archive needs
no private GitHub access after download. `SOURCE.json` in the Chrome ZIP binds
it to the source archive's name and SHA-256. Make that archive accessible and
put its public download location in the listing before distribution.

The **Release** workflow can package any selected ref without publishing when
run manually. For automatic publication, commit a new manifest version and push
the exact tag `<manifest.version>` (for example, `0.1.2`). The tag run validates the version and
browser contract, rebuilds and checksum-verifies the same three files, preserves
them as a workflow artifact, creates the corresponding GitHub release, then
uploads the Chrome ZIP and submits it for review.

For a manually created release such as `0.1.1`, first ensure its tag points to
the selected commit on `main`, then run **Release** with that ref and
**Publish** enabled. The workflow derives the bare release tag from
`manifest.version`, verifies that it points to the packaged commit, uploads or
replaces the three release assets, and submits the same Chrome ZIP. Manual runs
leave **Publish** disabled by default and remain package checks only.

Store submissions block on validation warnings and use `DEFAULT_PUBLISH`, so an
approved update becomes public without another workflow run. Do not move or
reuse a tag after its package has been submitted.

Before the first automated release, link a service account to the publisher and
configure these GitHub repository settings:

- Actions secret `CHROME_WEBSTORE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`: the complete service
  account JSON credential.
- Actions variable `CHROME_WEBSTORE_PUBLISHER_ID`: the value shown under
  **Publisher → Settings** in the Developer Dashboard.
- Actions variable `CHROME_WEBSTORE_EXTENSION_ID`: the existing store item ID.

Rotate credentials by replacing the GitHub secret, and never commit the JSON
key.

Extract the Chrome ZIP into a temporary directory and load that directory in a
fresh Chrome profile to check the exact upload contents. Verify setup, lookup,
local audio and any configured optional features. Keep private dictionaries,
backups, browser profiles and personal recordings out of the distribution.

### 3. Register the publisher account

Open the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole),
accept the terms and pay the one-time registration fee shown there. Enable
Google Account 2-Step Verification, choose a publisher name and verify a contact
email you monitor. Complete any identity and trader/non-trader declaration the
dashboard requests based on the publisher's actual situation.
See [registration](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/register),
[account setup](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/set-up-account) and
[trader identification](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/trader-disclosure).

### 4. Prepare the listing

Use accurate, readable copy. A proposed **single purpose** is:

> Help users read Japanese with local dictionary lookups and save selected
> vocabulary and study context to Anki.

Suggested short description, if adopted in the release manifest:

> Japanese hover dictionary with local Yomitan lookup, pronunciation and Anki study tools.

The longer description should cover supported reading pages, automatic starter
dictionary downloads, local lookup/storage, pronunciation provider behavior,
optional Anki features. Explain that Anki
Desktop with AnkiConnect is needed for mining; ordinary lookup works without it.
Link a publicly reachable project/support destination and the published privacy
policy. The current [issue tracker](https://github.com/bee-san/hachidori/issues)
is only accessible to repository collaborators; do not use it as the sole public
support route while the repository is private. Choose the closest current
education/language category and the actual listing language.

Use the files and reproduction instructions in [Store assets](store/README.md)
for these [required store images](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/images):

- A **128 × 128 PNG icon**; [`hachidori-128.png`](../extension/icons/hachidori-128.png)
  already exists. Check its appearance against Google's artwork/padding guidance.
- A **440 × 280 small promotional tile**.
- **At least one screenshot**, up to five, at **1280 × 800** or **640 × 400**.
  The supplied welcome and hover-lookup screenshots use original sample text
  and definitions, with no personal browsing content.
- An optional **1400 × 560 marquee image** if desired.

The [asset ownership record](asset-rights.md) documents the supplied Hachidori
logo pack and all six visual novel backgrounds, including the owner's copyright
declaration, original filenames and image checksums. Use it as the artwork
reference for the package and publishing screenshots.

### 5. Upload and complete review information

In the dashboard, choose **Add new item**, upload the ZIP, and complete Store
listing, Privacy practices, Distribution and Test instructions. Supply the
single purpose, actual permission justifications, policy URL and accurate data
categories. For the audited local JS/WASM implementation, the remote-code answer
is **No**; re-audit dependencies if the candidate changes.

Use Public for general discovery, Unlisted for link-based access, or Private
for selected testers. Visibility does not bypass policy review.
See [publishing](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/publish) and
[distribution settings](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/cws-dashboard-distribution).

Provide reviewer instructions specific to Hachidori:

1. Install in a fresh profile. Read the short welcome and click **Start setup**.
   Setup sequentially downloads the five starter dictionaries; failures offer
   retry. Anki discovery is read-only and
   absence of Anki does not prevent dictionary lookup.
2. At **Try it**, hold Shift and hover over a word in the Japanese sample to see a
   real dictionary result. The popup stays open after Shift is released.
   Also test an ordinary Japanese webpage; Chrome internal pages and the store
   itself are restricted surfaces.
3. Reach Settings from setup or `chrome://extensions` → Hachidori details →
   **Extension options**. This manifest does not define a toolbar-action popup.
4. Test custom entries and local counts. For Anki, run Anki Desktop with
   AnkiConnect, configure a disposable deck/note type and map fields. If an origin
   grant is needed, use the uploaded extension's actual ID rather than an old
   unpacked ID. Explicitly add a note and verify its content.

No Hachidori account is needed. Give reviewers any additional test access that
the final configured features actually require, never a personal Anki backup or
real API key.

### 6. Submit, publish and maintain

Choose **Submit for Review**. For a controlled launch, disable automatic
publication after approval and publish manually when ready. Google's current
guide gives staged approvals **30 days** before they revert to draft. Review
duration varies; monitor dashboard status and email. A valid upload is not
approval. Fix a rejection's cited issue and resubmit the corrected candidate.

After publication, install the store build in a fresh profile and repeat the
onboarding/lookup checks, including the new extension ID for local integrations.
Update the README with the actual listing link and verify the privacy and
source-download links without signing in. Unpacked and store installations
can have different IDs and separate storage; use Hachidori's backup/restore if
migration is needed, and retain the old installation until the restore is
verified.

For subsequent releases, push a matching release tag with a higher manifest
version. The workflow uploads the ZIP to the **same store item** and submits it
for review. Refresh disclosures/assets when behavior changes, and follow the
[update process](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/update).
Dictionary data updates use Hachidori's own source/update mechanism; extension
JavaScript and Wasm changes ship through store updates.
