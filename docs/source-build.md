# Building a distributed source archive

Each release's `hachidori-<version>-<commit>-source.zip` includes Hachidori's
tracked files, the complete recursive Hoshidicts submodules, and the pinned
unminified zip.js source. It contains no Git metadata and
does not require access to a private repository. `SOURCE_REVISIONS.json`
records the repository commits and downloaded dependency checksums.

The Chrome upload ZIP contains `LICENSE`, the dependency notices,
`SOURCE.txt` and `SOURCE.json`. The source reference names the accompanying
archive and its SHA-256. Publish that exact source archive at a public download
location and put the location in the store listing before distributing the
extension. A private GitHub repository link is not a substitute for that
download.

## Load the JavaScript source

Extract the archive. Open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**,
choose **Load unpacked**, and select its `extension/` directory. Committed
Wasm files are included, so JavaScript development needs no compiler.

## Rebuild the dictionary engine

Install [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)
with C++23 support, CMake 3.31 or newer, and a native build tool. Activate the
SDK environment so `emcmake`, `emcc`, and `em++` are on `PATH`. Run these commands
from the extracted archive's top-level directory:

```sh
emcmake cmake -S wasm -B wasm/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DHACHIDORI_PTHREADS=ON -DHACHIDORI_WASMFS=ON
cmake --build wasm/build --parallel
emcmake cmake -S wasm -B wasm/build-idbfs -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DHACHIDORI_PTHREADS=ON -DHACHIDORI_WASMFS=OFF
cmake --build wasm/build-idbfs --parallel
emcmake cmake -S wasm -B wasm/build-fallback -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DHACHIDORI_PTHREADS=OFF
cmake --build wasm/build-fallback --parallel
cp wasm/build/hoshidicts-threaded.mjs wasm/build/hoshidicts-threaded.wasm extension/vendor/
cp wasm/build-idbfs/hoshidicts-threaded-idbfs.mjs wasm/build-idbfs/hoshidicts-threaded-idbfs.wasm extension/vendor/
cp wasm/build-fallback/hoshidicts.mjs wasm/build-fallback/hoshidicts.wasm extension/vendor/
```

The source archive already includes each CMake dependency under
`third_party/hoshidicts/external/`; no submodule checkout is needed.

## zip.js and validation

`third_party/store-sources/zipjs/lib/` contains zip.js 2.11.2's editable source;
its upstream `README.md` and `package.json` describe the library. The release
uses its existing `dist/zip-core-external.min.js`, copied unchanged to
`extension/vendor/zip.js`. No npm install or JavaScript build is needed to
restore that shipped file:

```sh
cp third_party/store-sources/zipjs/dist/zip-core-external.min.js extension/vendor/zip.js
node test/make-fixture.mjs
node test/node-smoke.mjs
node test/extension-smoke.mjs
```

See [the test guide](../test/README.md) for the browser suite and its external
test dependencies. The packaging command verifies archive checksums and file
integrity; it does not compile or run these runtime suites.

These instructions preserve the source revisions and build settings. The
historical committed Wasm files do not record the exact compiler version, so
they do not establish byte-for-byte reproduction of those binaries. Record
`emcc --version`, `cmake --version`, build commands and test results whenever
publishing newly built Wasm files.

## Produce a release pair from a Git checkout

Commit the intended release changes and initialize recursive submodules. With
Python 3.9 or newer and Git installed:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
python3 scripts/package-store.py --output-dir /tmp/hachidori-store
```

The command refuses a dirty checkout, reads only committed Git objects, and
writes the upload ZIP, source ZIP and `SHA256SUMS.txt` outside the repository.
Its first run downloads only checksum-pinned dependency sources. Pass
`--cache-dir /path/to/cache` to reuse them across machines or offline runs.
ZIP paths, timestamps, order and permissions are normalized, giving identical
bytes when repeated with the same commit and Python/zlib version. ZIP integrity
is checked before checksums are written. Load unpacked from an extracted Chrome
ZIP to check the exact staged runtime before uploading it.

CI runs this packaging command and verifies the checksums for every release
candidate. The **Release** workflow supports package-only manual runs by default.
Enabling **Publish** for a manual run requires an existing bare
`<manifest.version>` release tag at the selected commit; the workflow uploads
its assets and submits the Chrome package. Pushing `<manifest.version>` keeps
the automatic release path. Both paths publish only after the version,
minimum/current Chrome pins, archive integrity, and checksums pass. Chrome Web
Store automation requires the service-account secret and the publisher and
extension repository variables documented in
[the publishing guide](chrome-web-store.md#publish-step-by-step).
