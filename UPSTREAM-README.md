# Blazing Fast

Hachidori is 83 times faster than the worlds most popular Japanese dictionary app at importing dictionaries.

See [the measured results](docs/browser-performance.md).


# Custom Dictionary

Do you keep on seeing a name pop up over & over again in a book, but it's not in the dictionary? 

With Hachidori, you can highlight the word and add it as a custom definition.

Never add your own words? Turn off **Settings → Library → Personal dictionary →
Use the personal dictionary** and highlighting text no longer opens a popup.

</p>

# Lookup blur

Sometimes we fall into a trap of looking up a word over & over again, but never learning it.

Hachidori records how many times you have looked up a word and can blur it for you for a few seconds to force you to remember it.

It can even use anki.

# Sharing

Set up Hachidori once and use that setup from every other Hachidori, in GameSentenceMiner, another browser or another computer. Same dictionaries and settings used across multiple Hachidoris.

Install [Hachidori Relay for Anki](https://github.com/bee-san/hachidori-anki)
from **Settings → Sharing → Download the Anki add-on**, then follow the
[sharing guide](docs/sharing.md) to link your other browsers.

# Experimental features

**Settings → Advanced → Experimental features** switches on work that is still
changing and may be removed:

- **Long dictionary entries** — find entries longer than the scan length
  (proverbs, titles) without scanning further on every hover.
- **MDX dictionaries** — import MDict `.mdx` dictionaries with their `.mdd`
  resource files from **Add dictionaries**, next to Yomitan ZIPs. Choose the
  `.mdx` and its `.mdd` files together. When an import leaves something out
  (unreadable entries, aliases with no target, or images and styles no `.mdd`
  provides), its row says so with a note for each.
- **Google Docs** — look up words while reading a Google Doc. Docs paints its
  text to a canvas; Hachidori asks it to expose the text as well, which Google
  may change or remove without notice. The sentence is the hovered run of text.
- **Smaller Anki cards** — write compact definitions to new Anki notes. The
  dictionary stylesheets, classes and wrappers are left out; the text, line
  breaks, lists, tables, furigana, images and the markers note types such as
  Lapis, Kiku and Senren rely on are kept. As in Yomitan, the definition ends
  without a Rules/Deinflection line; use `{part-of-speech}` and
  `{conjugation}` for that information. A Jitendex note shrinks to about a
  quarter of its size. Notes already in Anki are not changed. The behaviour
  follows the Compact HTML Cleanup Anki add-on.


# Opinionated

Hachidori is an opinionated program. If it does not benefit me, the creator, personally than I will not add that feature.

I do this because I am a pretty average learner, and if I make this tool great for myself than I am making it great for the average Japanese learner.

# AI Usage

This program was created with the assistance of AI. I used GPT 5.6 Ultra, and then GPT 6.0 Astra Ultra exclusively. When Codex goes down, I use Fable 5.1 with ultrathink and ultracode.

I have reviewed all plans, I set the direction of how this program works. Large parts of the program such as the actual dictionary core are hand-written. 

I also have personally been using this for months, and as I am the main user of this program I find bugs pretty often which I fix.

The assets used are AI generated. If you are an artist and want to contribute to open source, please feel free to make a real logo or a visual novel style background.
